The Word Definer

Make an application that contains a Word class.

The homepage of the app should list all words.

When a word is clicked, it should lead to a page with the word's definitions.

Children should be able to add a word.

When viewing a word, be able to add one or more definitions.

When viewing a word, be able to update one or more definitions.

When viewing a word, be able to delete one or more definitions.

This week you should deploy your application to Heroku so the kids can try it out!
